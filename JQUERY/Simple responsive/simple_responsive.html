          <h2>The Universe</h2>
         
          <p>The Universe is commonly defined as the totality of existence. This includes planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all matter and energy, the majority of which are most likely in the form of dark matter and dark energy. The part of the Universe that we can see, referred to as the observable universe, is about 91 billion light-years in diameter at the present time. The size of the whole universe is not known and may be infinite. Scientific observation of the Universe has led to inferences about its evolution.</p>

          <p>
The multiverse is the hypothetical set of infinite or finite possible universes (including the Universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists. the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. The various universes within the multiverse are sometimes called parallel universes or "alternate universes". The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationships among the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered.</p>
