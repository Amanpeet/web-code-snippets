# Contributing guidelines

Hello! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to yall.js.

As the [project README](https://github.com/malchata/yall.js/blob/master/README.md) states, _please_ file an issue rather than forking and submitting an unsolicited pull request. Unsolicited pull requests will almost certainly be rejected or left to languish, _unless_ they fix a demonstrable issue.

If you wish to extend yall.js to add functionality that's useful for you and want to merge it into this repo, I can't guarantee that I'll say yes. Opening an issue first starts a discussion where I can figure out if the request is something I want to take on or delegate. Additionally, yall.js is very fast in part because it's very small. Any major feature requests are likely to be rejected if the scope of the proposed functionality will significantly add to the final build size.

If anything is unclear here, file an issue and let's talk.
